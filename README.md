## .csv parser

run `parser.py` (in the `csv_test` folder) on the command line, i.e., `'python parser.py'`

the parser must be run in the same directory as the `state_abbreviations.csv` file

if you don't provide a `.csv` file to parse (i.e., `'python parser.py test.csv'`), the parser will ask for one

files will be parsed according to specific instructions as specified by Enigma (that is, this isn't a very useful general-purpose `.csv` parserâ€”one useful modification might be for the parser to take, as an additional argument, a second Python program specifying how data will be cleaned / parsed / transformed)

a parsed `solution.csv` file will be created in the same directory as the input file
